# Luck System
A Foundry VTT version 13 module for the **new** default D&D 5e sheet that replaces the Inspiration system with Luck Points. Based on the Tales of the Valiant ruleset (and intended for 5e 2014 rules), it deactivates the Inspiration button and converts it to a player-spendable Luck Point tracker.

Luck Point Mechanics:

* Gain 1 Luck Point (LP) on a missed attack or saving throw (max 5 LPs).

* If a player gains a sixth LP, roll a 1d4 - the outcome is their new LP total.

* Spend 1 LP for +1 to a d20 roll (after the roll).

* Spend 3 LPs to re-roll a d20 check.

Shamelessly vibe coded with Gemini for a group that I DM for.

bgebhardt: Forked sgeep's version and vibe coded more with Claude to add Foundry V12 and D&D 5e v3.3.1 compatibility.
