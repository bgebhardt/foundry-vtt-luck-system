# foundry-vtt-luck-system
A module for the Foundry VTT 5e system (intended for Legacy 2014 rules) that aims to replace the Inspiration system with Luck Points, based on the system from the 5e RPG Tales of the Vailant.

The general gist of it (taken directly from Sly Flourish's website):
* Every time a character misses an attack or a saving throw, they gain one luck point.
* They can only hold up to five luck points. If they gain a sixth luck point, they roll 1d4 and that's how many luck points they have now.
* They can spend one luck point to get +1 to a D20 roll after they roll.
* They can spend three luck points to re-roll a d20 check.

GMs can award luck points for good roleplaying, brave behavior, and other times we might award inspiration but players will primarily gain luck with missed attacks and saving throws (not ability checks.)
